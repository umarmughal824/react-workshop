#### Environment Setup
> For this workshop, we use the following set of tools and technologies:
* [Node.js v7+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn!](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)

* [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) _(Browser Extension)_

#### Project Setup
> The demo project can be setup by the procedure mentioned below.

Run the following commands in the exact order in order to download project dependencies and start the project.
* `$ cd react-workshop`
* `$ yarn install`
* `$ yarn start`


#### ES6 Primer
> The next (and much better) version of JavaScript that helps write consistent and error-free code.
* `let` / `const`
* template literals
* Classes
* Arrow functions
* Object Literal Enhancements
* Default Parameter Values
* Object Spread Operator
* Destructuring
* Module Exports / Imports

#### Introduction to JSX
> JSX allows writing Markup in JavaScript. It's a utility that helps developers create React components quickly and seamlessly.
* Code: `LessonJSX`

* [React: Rethinking best practices](https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY)


#### React Elements
> Elements are the basic building blocks of React apps. They represent how DOM should look like at a certain time.
* Code: `LessonElements`

**Study Links**:
* [Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)


#### Components and Props
> Components can be used to build complete views in React. Each component needs some data to display or to work with.
This data is known as Props.
* Code: `LessonCompProps`

* [React Components, Elements and Instances](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html)
* [React Props Basics](https://kolosek.com/react-props-basic/)
* [Typechecking with PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

#### State and Lifecycle
> React's state allows us sto store and manipulate data in a component. Lifecycle hooks enable us to perform operations during certain points in the execution lifecycle of the component.
* Code: `LessonStateLifeHooks`

#### Event Handling in React
> Similar to DOM event handling with a few convention differences as well as knowledge of binding functions with classes.
* Code: `Lessons.js` / `LessonState.js` / `LessonHooks.js` / `Profile.js`

#### State Lift-up
> Move components' state to common ancestors when state trees start to get duplicated in children components.
* Code: `LessonStateLiftUp > part1 / part2 > TemperatureCalculator`

* [ReactJS docs: Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
